        "1. *Spatial Hierarchy*: CNNs can capture spatial hierarchies of features in images, which is essential for image classification.\n",
        "2. *Local Connectivity*: CNNs use local connectivity, which allows them to focus on specific regions of the image.\n",
        "3. *Shared Weights*: CNNs use shared weights, which reduces the number of parameters and improves generalization.\n",
